            In this role, my focus was on lowering barriers for other teams at the company to contribute to Luna. For a design system to be successful, it requires buy-in from everyone at the company. One way to get this investment is to ensure that anyone can contribute; thus providing everyone a sense of ownership.
          </P>

          <P className="mt-3">
            Our solution was the creation of Community Contribution Libraries (CCLs). The Luna CCL development environment, which implements <TextLink to="https://storybook.js.org/" title="" external={true}>Storybook</TextLink>, is pleasant to work in. It increases developer velocity while reducing frustration. Luna CCLs also lower the collaboration barrier between designers and engineers.
          </P>

          <P className="mt-3">
            The Luna CCLs were also used to improve and implement better testing standards/practices. CCLs were built from the start to lower the effort required for engineers to implement tests and increase test coverage and variety; including real-time and regression testing for accessibility, components, and screens.
          </P>

          <P className="mt-3">
            To govern the use of CCLs, I launched our Community Contribution Model. This model offers guidelines for CCL candidacy, lifecycle, and core promotion.
