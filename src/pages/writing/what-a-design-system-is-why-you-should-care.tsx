            Have you ever wondered how some designers, developers, or companies get their digital products to look so ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù and professional? They seem to captivate and earn a user's trust instantaneously. Have you had trouble getting your own digital products to reach the same level of presentational nirvana? Have you asked yourself what could possibly be their secret? If only you, too, could get your hands on some of that magic sauce.

            So, what is this design Qi that only the most elite and practiced of developers and designers can tap into? Are you ready for it? I‚Äôm about to tell you the answer to life, the universe, and everything. No, the answer is not 42. The answer is <em>systems</em>. Specifically <em>design systems</em>.

            >Thinking in Systems</TextLink>, Donella H. Meadows explains that a system must consist of three kinds of things:
          </p>
          <ul className="pb-4 mt-4 leading-relaxed tracking-wider list-disc list-inside text-stone-600 sm:px-8">
            <li>elements,</li>
            <li>interconnections, and</li>
            <li>a function or purpose</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed tracking-wider text-stone-600">
            Applying this to digital products:
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed tracking-wider text-stone-600">
            <strong>A design system is a source of truth for designing and building digital products consisting of foundations (color, typography, depth, spacing, ‚Ä¶) and guidelines (patterns, shared practices, components, ‚Ä¶).</strong>

            >Figma</TextLink> give us thousands of options regarding space, color, type, depth, and much more. This affords us incredible latitude for creativity. However, this much flexibility can also be a curse. Building a digital product without constraints is like trying to build a straw house from individual strands of hay, or trying to build a brick house from individual grains of sand. You wouldn‚Äôt do it because it would be torture. You would instead start by compressing the hay into bales, or the sand into bricks. Perhaps you would have a handful of sizes of bales or bricks to choose from for different parts of the house. These constraints, defined in advance, make the process of assembling the house considerably less complicated.

          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed tracking-wider text-stone-600">
            Likewise, by placing constraints on your design choices in advance, a design system eliminates decision fatigue, enforces consistency, and speeds up the design and engineering process. By reducing your cognitive load, a design system will leave you with more time and energy to spend on other aspects of your digital product, such as creating better user interactions.

          <h3 className="mt-10 text-xl tracking-wide text-stone-700">Working with systems</h3>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed tracking-wider text-stone-600">
            Digital companies invest a ton of resources to build and maintain their design systems. They do this because their design system (usually) defines their brand. Their design system will inform their brand guidelines and visual identity such as how the company relates to its customers through color, voice, tone, and product interactions. However, you don‚Äôt have to be a multi-billion dollar company, or a design firm, with large teams of specialists to apply design system sensibilities to your projects.

            There are many open-source options available. Some are a better choice than others. For example, <em>Material Design</em>, a <em>design language</em> (synonymous with design system) created and open sourced by Google, is a popular choice among the uninitiated. This design language, published at <TextLink

          <h3 className="mt-10 text-xl tracking-wide text-stone-700">Begin with solid foundations</h3>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed tracking-wider text-stone-600">
            As mentioned previously, a design system will consist of both <em>foundations</em> and <em>guidelines</em>. Many of a design system‚Äôs guidelines; such as patterns, best practices, and components; are built from the system's foundations. Foundations are the fundamental building blocks of a design system. Defining these foundations can require painstaking effort with a strong attention to detail. Some open-source libraries aim to provide these foundations for you out of the box, while being careful not to inflict any guideline-related patterns.

            >Tailwind CSS</TextLink> is one such system. Often referred to as a ‚Äúutility only‚Äù CSS library<sup>1</sup>, Tailwind CSS is one of the most elegant open-source systems.

Once you set up Tailwind with your customizations, such as your brand's color pallets, one can readily jump right into building brand guidelines. There are other utility class libraries available, but my experience is that none are as polished as Tailwind.

            Working with a proper system will make you a better designer/developer. Limiting your options in advance will reduce decision fatigue, enforce consistency ‚Äî especially when working with a team, and reduce development time. If you have never worked with a system, starting from scratch can be daunting. If you are new to systems, I recommended that you start with an existing high-quality foundational system to familiarize yourself with systems thinking. Lastly, To get a feel for what makes a design system successful, take time to explore the design systems of some of the world's most successful brands:
